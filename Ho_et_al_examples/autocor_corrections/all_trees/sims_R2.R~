Ten data sets per simulation settings, with a root age of 10 time units. In all cases, the number of variable sites is between 5300 and 4800 in alignments of 10000 variable sites

Use rates that are 1 order of magnitude lower, as Reviewer 1 suggests.

    - Check sequence variation. It should be around 500 variables sites
