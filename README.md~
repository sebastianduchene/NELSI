This is the home of NELSI: Nucleotide Evolutionary rate Simulator

This is the list of potential functions:

- molrate.sim (currently molrate.sim.tree)
  - ~~strict clock X~~
  - ~~uncorrelated lognormal X~~
  - ~~uncorrelated exponential~~
  - ~~uncorrelated gamma~~
  - ~~autocorrelated Kishino (2001) X~~
  - ~~autocorrelated Thorne (1998) X~~
  - ?White noise
  - ~~Time dependent exponential decay~~

- ~~get.tree.data.matrix~~

- ~~get.rate.descendant.pairs~~

- ~~allnode.times (if used for substitutions and time, then it can be used for linear regression to test for clocklike behaviour as in path-o-gen)X~~

- ~~mid.ages~~

- ~~pathnode with modifications ( for Node density effect)~~

- ~~plot rates trough time along lineages~~

- NEW plot root to tip distance with a chronogram and a phylogram

The dependencies are:

- APE

- GEIGER

- PHANGORN
