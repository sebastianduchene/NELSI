This is the home of NELSI: Nucleotide Evolutionary rate Simulator

This is the list of potential functions:

- molrate.sim (currently molrate.sim.tree)

- get.tree.data.matrix

- get.rate.descendant.pairs

- allnode.times (if used for substitutions and time, then it can be used for linear regression to test for clocklike behaviour as in path-o-gen)

- mid.ages

- pathnode with modifications ( for Node density effect)





The dependencies are:
